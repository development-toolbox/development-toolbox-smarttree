  docs(project): add comprehensive documentation infrastructure

- Add shell completion support for Bash, Zsh, and Fish
  - Created generate_completions.py to auto-generate completion scripts
  - Completions provide tab-autocomplete for all options and paths

- Add Unix man page (smarttree.1)
  - Complete manual with examples, options, and .treeignore documentation
  - Automatically compressed to .gz format for distribution

- Add documentation setup automation
  - Makefile for building and installing docs
  - setup.sh for one-command setup experience
  - DOCUMENTATION.md guide explaining all documentation types

- Update packaging configuration
  - Modified pyproject.toml to include man pages and completions
  - Added MANIFEST.in to ensure docs are included in distribution

- Add installation helpers
  - Local user installation support
  - System-wide installation options
  - PyPI distribution building integrated

This provides users with familiar Unix-style documentation (man smarttree),
modern shell completions, and sets foundation for future online docs.
